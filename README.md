# UNIX-Bash-Scripting
* Displays the permission of a directory and all the directories in the directory's absolute path.
* Show other information about the directories, as the cursor is moved up and down the list of directory names
* Facilitate changing permission of the directories, assuming that you are the owner of the appropriate directory or the superuser

* Will accept one argument, the name of a directory, including the path if required
* If there is no argument specified, then the current directory will be the default
* If there is more than one argument specified, there will be an error message and the script terminated (exit status 1) with no full-screen display
